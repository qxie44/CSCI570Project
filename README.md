# CSCI570Project
This is the CSCI 370 project for Spring 2025. This project aims to implement a basic version and a dynamic version of an algorithm for sequence alignment.
To run the algorithms, use the bash script ie.) ./efficient.sh input1.txt output.txt 
to insert the input file and the name of the desired output file.
